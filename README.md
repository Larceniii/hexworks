## New to HEX?

HEX is an ERC Token on Ethereum that is designed to increase in value over time. 
It is an high interest earning token with a twist - to get the higher interest, you must time-lock your funds!

What does this mean? It means that while your funds are locked away for X - days it generates interest.
Here's the  great part - you can lock it for any amount of time - 10 days, 30 days, 365 days, and the longer your locking period, the more interest you get PAID.

So what happens when you lock up coins? The available supply becomes lower. Which drives the price up. Yes, it's THAT simple!
When your coins are released from their time-lock, their value will be much more, AND you got more while you were HODLING.

# For the next 1 year you can get HEX offically in 1 of two ways.

### What you need to know to get started.

#### Method 1: Claiming free HEX for owning Bitcoin
If you have BTC in your possesion (Your keys, your BTC; not your keys, not your BTC!) then you can claim some for free anytime in the next year! Simply sign a message using your wallet and the HEX coins go into your HEX wallet. Not even a single satoshi will be spent or transmitted! Completely safe!

#### Method 2: Buy with ETH
But if you don't have BTC before that timer goes out, the snapshot period will be over and you will have missed the chance to claim some HEX for free. But don't dispair! You can buy HEX anytime within the next year using ETH.

Buying HEX with ETH is very straight forward, but how much you recieve reduces by half each day you wait. So it's important you do not wait!
