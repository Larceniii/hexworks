## New to HEX?

HEX is an ERC Token on Ethereum that is designed to increase in value over time. 
It is an high interest earning token with a twist - to get the higher interest, you must time-lock your funds!

What does this mean? It means that while your funds are locked away for X - days it generates interest.
Here's the  great part - you can lock it for any amount of time - 10 days, 30 days, 365 days, and the longer your locking period, the more interest you get PAID.

So what happens when you lock up coins? The available supply becomes lower. Which drives the price up. Yes, it's THAT simple!
When your coins are released from their time-lock, their value will be much more, AND you got more while you were HODLING.
